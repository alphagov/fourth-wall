## How to use

The project is hosted through Github pages:
`http://alphagov.github.io/fourth-wall/?token=_token_&gist=_gist_id_`

You will need to have a Github API token with access to the relevant
repositories if you don't already have one. To do that, visit
https://github.com/settings/applications and create a new personal
access token. To use the `team` parameter you will need to give the token
the `read:org` permission.

The following query parameters are required:

 - `token`: Your Github API token

At least one of:

 - `gist`: ID of the Gist containing the list of repositories to monitor.
 - `team`: Github organisation and team name to build the list of repositories in the form `{org}/{team}` (requires the [`read:org`](https://developer.github.com/v3/orgs/) permission).
 - `team[]`: Given multiple times allows for more than one team to be used to build the list of repositories.
 - `file`: URL of a file in a Github repo that contains the list of repositories.

Optional query parameters:

 - `listinterval`: Update interval for the list of monitored repos in seconds (default: 900)
 - `interval`: Update interval for monitored repos in seconds (default: 60)
 - `filterusers`: Only show PRs from specific users, if set in config (default: false)

The Gist should contain one or more JSON files with this syntax:
```json
[
  {
    "userName": "<username of the repo owner>",
    "repo": "<repository name>"
  }
]
```

You must make sure you set the language of the Gist to JSON as it will
default to Text, which will not work.

Optionally, entries may also contain ```"important": true``` to indicate that a
repository is important.  This has an effect only when the `filterusers` param
is set: PRs on important repositories will always be displayed, even when they
weren't opened by one of the listed users.

## Custom styling

If the Gist contains a file with the language set to `CSS`, it will be injected
into a `<style>` block in the document head, so you can override the default
styling without having to fork this repo.

## Important users

Optionally, the Gist can contain a JSON file named `users.json`, to list
users the team cares about. Fourth Wall can then display PRs
across your tracked apps opened by these users, if the `filterusers` param is set. Syntax:
```json
[
  "username0",
  "username1"
]
```

## Ignoring repositories

The Gist can also contain a JSON file named `ignored-repos.json`. This file should be
formatted the same as the repository list file but rather than including the repositories
listed they will be ignored. This can be useful if you're building your repository list
teams but would like to prevent your dashboard user from seeing some of them.

## Support for other githubs

If you use github enterprise you must add the `baseUrl` to each repo object and
add a token for that hostname. The url parameter for the other hostname should
 be of the form `<hostname>_token`.

An example enterprise repository.

```json
[
  {
    "baseUrl": "https://myhost.com/api/v3/repos",
    "userName": "<username of the repo owner>",
    "repo": "<repository name>"
  }
]
```

To load repositories from a team on an enterprise instance you must prefix the
hostname to the team url parameter as with the token `<hostname>_team` (or
`<hostname>_team[]` for multiple teams).
